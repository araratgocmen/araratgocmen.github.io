        <p>Why do businesses financially support certain political parties? 
          Extensive research finds that while individuals tend to donate to single 
          political parties expressively or ideologically, companies will tend to donate more 
          strategically, hedging bets across parties, and treating campaign contributions as 
          short term investments for influence and access. I assemble the universe of disclosed 
          corporate donations to political parties in India between 2003-2020, and find that
          corporate donations can reveal a more expressive logic: over 90%
          of companies donating to a single political party--puzzling in a highly
          federalized, competitive multi-party democracy. I explain this
          non-strategic behavior by recognizing the predominance of the family
          business in India's corporate landscape. I draw on the finance and
          economic sociology literatures to develop a political theory of family
          firms that argues family firms are more than economic entities, but
          social entities as well. Families are embedded in social networks and relationships, and by concentrated control over a firm's operations in the hands of a single family, the firm's political actions begin to mirror the preferences of the individuals in charge. I employ
          administrative data on corporate board membership to develop a
          measure of family involvement on a corporate board, and find family firms
          are less likely to hedge their bets, preferring to stick to their chosen party, producing donation patterns more similar to individual giving. Next, I study if social embeddings help predict <i>which</i> party family firms support. I develop a measure of
          firm-party ethnic proximity by using name matching as a proxy for
          subcaste-matching, and I show how the choice of which political party a
          firm chooses to donate to is predicted by ethnic proximity. This effect is particularly salient for family firms. These results show how the most ubiquitous type
          of firm in the world can subordinate economic interests for social
          identity, raising important challenges for channels of accountability
          between business and government.</p>
