        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at MIT, specializing in Political Economy and Quantitative Methods. 
          I study business and politics in emerging economies, and am writing a dissertation about family firms in India. <br>
        I graduated with Honors in Economics from Princeton University, and prior to MIT, I worked as an investment analyst at Goldman Sachs.   </p>

        <b>Cross-Pressured Business: Ethnic Attachments of the Family Firm</b> <br>

        <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>An extensive money in politics literature finds that while individuals may donate to political parties expressively or consumptively, companies tend to contribute strategically, wielding donations as investments for influence or access. But what about cases where one cannot separate the individual from the company? The family firm is the most ubiquitous corporate form in the world, and often concentrates control in the hands of few individual family membersâ€”typically the patriarch. I argue, first, that by concentrating control, the family firm has more discretion to deviate from the strategic optimal and make more expressive choices in the political arena. Next, I argue that family firms are more than an economic entity, but a social entity as well, which shapes their specific political choices. I assemble the universe of corporate campaign donations to political parties in India between 2003-2020 and find first, that family involvement on corporate boards is associated with more expressive single-party giving; and second, that family firms are more likely to give expressively to co-ethnic political parties, without clear expectation of short-term economic return. </p>
