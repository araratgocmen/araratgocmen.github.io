        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at MIT, specializing in Political Economy and Quantitative Methods. 
          I study business and politics in emerging economies, and am writing a dissertation about family firms in India. MIT News covered my work <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/all-in-family-sukrit-puri-0604" target="_blank">here.</a>
          <br><br>
        I graduated with Honors in Economics from Princeton University, and prior to MIT, I worked as an investment analyst at Goldman Sachs.  
          <br><br>
        I am on the fall 2024 academic job market. 
      </p>

       <b>Corporate Kinship: Political Attachments of the Family Firm</b> <br>
        <i>Job Market Paper</i><br>
        <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>In documenting the ways corporations wield instrumental power over the state to extract returns, scholars treat business as a most likely case of an economically rational actor in the political arena. These theories tend to ignore how corporate structure affects a firm's political strategy. In this paper, I focus on the family business, the most common corporate form in the world, and show how it faces a series of non-economic incentives that distorts its politics. I borrow from finance and economic sociology to develop a political theory of family firms that predicts family firms deviating from short-run profit seeking behavior in the political arena, and exhibiting strong co-ethnic preferences instead. In order to test these theories, I assemble the universe of corporate campaign contributions to political parties in India from 2003-2021. Despite operating in a competitive multi-party environment, I find family involvement in firm operations is strongly associated with firms loyally supporting a single co-ethnic political party, without clear expectation of short-term economic return.

       <b>Reputational Costs of Revealing Political Connections: Evidence from Electoral Bonds in India</b> <br>
       <i>Under Review </i> <br>
       <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Why do companies choose to hide potentially beneficial political connections? I show that revealing political activities can hurt a company's valuation in the short run by tainting its reputation. I take advantage of a unique setting where the Election Commission of India suddenly revealed a list of previously-anonymous corporate donors to political parties. Publicly listed companies revealed to be political donors experienced a 1.5% cumulative abnormal underperformance over the next 7 days as a result of this information shock, amounting to an erosion of approximately $9 billion in market capitalization---over 5 times the amount raised by political parties in the first place. The effect is short-lived and is largely driven by companies facing negative press immediately following the reveal.</p>

        <b>Mapping the Landscape of Corporate Campaign Contributions to Political Parties in India</b> <br>
        <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The study of money in politics has largely remained restricted to developed countries, where data are more readily available. But the concerns about corporate political funding, and how business influences the state broadly, are a global phenomenon. I collect all donations to political parties in India between 2003-2020, by taking advantage of a successful Right to Information Act that require all political parties to disclose donations made above Rs 20,000 (approx 250 USD). By applying various exact, fuzzy, and manual string matching techniques, I am able to uniquely identify the universe of around 7000 corporate donors making donations to approximately 45 political parties over the 17 year period. In this paper, I introduce this dataset, describe a set of five stylized facts about the nature of corporate-political linkages in the world's largest democracy, and highlight a set of empirical puzzles that challenge expectations from the literature and invite future scholarship on this topic. </p>
